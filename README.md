# MDLIVE QA Challenge

### my process

1. extracted requirements (guessed about order)
2. created model and controller
3. wrote tests
4. made tests pass
5. switcfh to api
6. add json serializer
7. 
?. deployment


### My Solution

1. relying on default arguments

### assumptions

- order defaults to ascending
- order accepts only ascending or descending
- order defaults to ascending if invalid value provided
- results are ordered before they are start-end constrained
